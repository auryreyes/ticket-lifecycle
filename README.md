<h3>Assignment and Communication</h3>
Typically, an administrator, manager, or supervisor will decide which employee should resolve which ticket. The person in charge of assigning tickets will make that decision because there are typically several levels of priority. In this instance, Jane is giving herself the ticket to solve the Sev-A problem.

<h3>Resolution</h3>
