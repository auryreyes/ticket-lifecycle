<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<h3>Intake</h3>
Intake occurs when a user submits a ticket to the helpdesk. In these examples, there are a number of different problems that occur.

<h3>Assignment and Communication</h3>
Typically, an administrator, manager, or supervisor will decide which employee should resolve which ticket. The person in charge of assigning tickets will make that decision because there are typically several levels of priority. In this instance, Jane is giving herself the ticket to solve the Sev-A problem.

<h3>Working the Issue</h3>
In this example, Jane is responding to the user and handling the ticket. Jane is collaborating with a different department to fix the problem.

<h3>Resolution</h3>
In this last example, Jane was successful in notifying the individual of the problem and resolving it. The ticket has been closed as a result.

Congratulations, you successfully completed your first ticket! Get more familiar and comfortable with the ticketing system, I would suggest working on more tickets to gain confidence, consistency and practice. The ticketing system is vital in the Help Desk profession.
